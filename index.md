## Who am I
Without getting into the biggest philosophical question, I am Mengsen Zhang, currently a Ph.D. student in the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University, under the mentorship of Drs. Emmanuelle Tognoli and J. A. Scott Kelso. I'm interested in how spatiotemporal patterns in biological and social systems form and change through the coordination of many components. (...more: [Why Complexity](/complexity.md))

## Current research
During Ph.D training, I have been studying human social coordination at the level of physiology, neural dynamics and social groups, both experimentally and theoretically. Overall, my work follows two themes:

### Multiagent social coordination
A lot the works on coordination phenomena focus on either systems of very few (often 2) or very many component (better to be infinite). The in-between was somewhat neglected. To understand coordination dynamics across scales, I felt necessary to bridge this gap between the very few and very many by studying the middle. I have developped a new experimental paradigm to study the coordination dynamics among eight humans. I designed and built an apparatus allowing people to coordinate rhythmic tapping in a controlled environment - it allows me to manipulate network connectivity in real time, and manipulate their tapping frequency with metronomes. 

We have recently published a paper ([here](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0193843)) about the first experiment using this paradigm, dubbed the "Human Firefly" experiment (become people's taps were displayed as flashes of LEDs, which looked like glowing fireflies in the dark). At micro level (interpersonal relations), we identified what phase relations people coordinate in (metastably, i.e. the coordination was intermittent - people come together and separate recurrently); at macro level (intergroup relations), we identified the critical level of frequency diversity that allowed the ensemble of eight to segregate into two frequency groups. 

Following the experiment, we have developped a mathematical model which successfully captured these key observations. The model also provided dynamic explanations for some of the statistical features in the experimental data. More importantly, it connects small-scale and large-scale coordination. The manuscript is in preparation but will soon be submitted. 

### Human-Virtual Partner interaction
I have conducted a series of experiments  I studied emotional and neural activities (EEG, fMRI)in humans during their coordination with a virtual partner.
