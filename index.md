### Who am I
Without getting into the biggest philosophical question, I am Mengsen Zhang, currently a Ph.D. student in the [Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences](http://www.ccs.fau.edu/) at Florida Atlantic University, under the mentorship of Drs. Emmanuelle Tognoli and J. A. Scott Kelso. (...more: [Why Complexity](/complex.md))

## Current research
#### Multiagent social coordination - experiment and model
I have developped a new experimental paradigm to study the coordination dynamics among eight humans. 
#### Human-Virtual Partner interaction
I studied emotional and neural activities (EEG, fMRI)in humans during their coordination with a virtual partner. 

### Other passion projects
#### CUDA programming
#### Topology
#### Pattern formation
