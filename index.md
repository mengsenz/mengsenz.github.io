### Who am I
Without getting into the biggest philosophical question, I am Mengsen Zhang, currently a Ph.D. student in the [Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences](http://www.ccs.fau.edu/) at Florida Atlantic University, under the mentorship of Drs. Emmanuelle Tognoli and J. A. Scott Kelso. 

Before that, I studied Pharmarceutical Science and Psychology as an undergrad, then Criminology as a Master student. Through this journey across the scales, I have looked at humans as molecular machines, cognitive processes, and constituents of a social organism, which at the end had led me to Complexity Science.
