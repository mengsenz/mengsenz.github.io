## Who am I
Without getting into the biggest philosophical question, I am Mengsen Zhang, currently a Ph.D. student in the Center for Complex Systems and Brain Sciences at Florida Atlantic University, under the mentorship of Drs. Emmanuelle Tognoli and J. A. Scott Kelso. I'm interested in how complex behavior and (spatiotemporal) structure in biological and social systems can be achieved through the coordination of many components. (...more: [Why Complexity](/complexity.md))

## Current research
During Ph.D training, I have been studying human social coordination at the level of physiology, neural dynamics and social groups, both experimentally and theoretically. Overall, my work follows two themes:
### Multiagent social coordination - experiment and model
I have developped a new experimental paradigm to study the coordination dynamics among eight humans. 
### Human-Virtual Partner interaction
I studied emotional and neural activities (EEG, fMRI)in humans during their coordination with a virtual partner. 

## Other passion projects
### CUDA programming
### Topology
### Pattern formation
