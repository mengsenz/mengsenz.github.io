### Why Complexity

I studied Pharmarceutical Science and Psychology as an undergrad, then Criminology as a Master student. Through this journey across the scales, I have looked at humans as molecular machines, cognitive pipelines, and constituents of a social organism, which eventually led me to Complexity Science. The desire to understand complexity is almost a coping mechanism of my brain to hold together very different perspectives of human identity. Human behavior is an interface between the micro and the macro: on one side, it is a global property coming out of  the relations between local properties, and on the other side, it is a local property being an element of a global property. What really got me to wonder is the similarity between the two tiers of local-global relations.
