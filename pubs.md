### Multiagent Coordination Dynamics
This section addresses my main interest in how multiple components can form complex structure/dynamics on multiple levels/scales of description as discovered in natural complex adaptive systems (e.g. living, social systems). In my doctoral work, I took an empirically based approach to the problem: I designed and built an [apparatus](/pics/ff_apparatus.png) to study how multiple people (N=8) coordinate their movement in a highly controlled experimental environment, where I can independently and dynamically manipulate individuals' movement rate and the network connectivity between them. First, a human experiment was conducted, dubbed "the Human Firelfy Experiment", where coordination phenomena were studied on multiple levels of description - interpersonal, intragroup and intergroup level. Subsequently, I modeled the experimental observations at all levels of description with a single system of equations. Finally, I explored a new, topology-based, approach to quantifying complex, multiscale dynamic patterns observed in the human experiment and the associated model. Together, I call them the *Firefly Trilogy*, which constitute my doctoral dissertation:

### Human Dynamic Clamp (HDC) and Human-Virtural Parter Interaction (VPI)
This group of studies investigate the neural and physiological changes in humans during social coordination with a "Virtual Partner" whose social coordinative behavior can be parameterically manipulated through modifying its governing equation. This was based on a new paradigm named the Human Dynamic Clamp (here's a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1407486111)).
