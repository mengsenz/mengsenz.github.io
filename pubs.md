> We did an experiment dubbed the "Human Firefly" experiment, to study how 8 people coordinate their rhythmic behavior together (but it's not really about the number eight - it's about connecting coordination phenomena at small and large scales). We made an [apparatus](/pics/ff_apparatus.png) to let people interact via touchpads and LED arrays while we can systematically manipulate network connectivity and diverisity in movement tempo. A theoretical sequel of this work is in the making.

> We studied emotional arousal (using SPR) of people while they were coordinating with a virtrual partner (VP). This was based on a new paradigm named the Human Dynamic Clamp (here's a [paper](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1407486111)), allowing a person to coordinate his/her movement with a mathematical model of social coordination.
